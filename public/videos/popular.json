        "description": "The United States and Iran faced off in a must-win situation for the US. The US came out aggressive and got off multiple shots on goal but they did not score. That all changed in the 38th minute when Sergiño Dest found Christian Pulisic with a perfectly timed pass and Pulisic put it into the back of the net. Pulisic was visibly hurt on the play. He wouldn’t return in the second half. Josh Sargent would come out of the game later after appearing to injure his leg. Iran had a shot on goal late on a free kick, but the US would hold on, marking three-straight knockout stage appearances in their last three World Cup appearances.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #UnitedStates #Iran\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.
